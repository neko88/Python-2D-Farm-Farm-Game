----- main.py -----
Create main.py file and basic files like settings.py and levels.py with imports.

Create a game class which initializes basic setup of the game:
    - pygame.init()
    - the screen
    - clock, and setting tick
    - run function
        - loop event for running game, condition for exit
        - update display

    Execute running of the game


---- levels.py -----
    pygame.display.get_surface() gets from the main surface screen
    and draws directly on it


---- player.py ----
    First we create 'image' with a placeholder of a sprite filled with a colour.
